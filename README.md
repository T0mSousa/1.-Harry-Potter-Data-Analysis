# A-magical-beginning
This marks my stepping stone in the R code journey. Why not start by something magical? Like Harry Potter data analysis!

In this analysisc I will be using RStudio, with a focus on Tidyverse library (ggplot) to plot and show relevant (and interesting)
about Harry Potter universe characters as well as an overview about the character lines of the first three movies!
