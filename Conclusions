#CHARACTERS PER HOUSE#

By a simple observation of the "Character per Magical House" histogram, it is obvious the hight number of male characters in both Gryffindor and Slytherin House.
Slytherin House being the "villains" house and "Gryffindor" the "heroes", it becomes clear why there is a higher amount of characters for these two houses.
Furthermore, it is also observable that both "Ravenclaw" and "Hufflepuff" houses have a similar amount of male characters.
As for females, "Ravenclaw" as pretty much the same amount of female students as male students, whereas "Hufflepuff" has slight less female students than male.
The remaining two houses, which are not from "Hogwarts" are smaller, hence the student count is low.
Attending to the fact that "Durmstrang Institute" and "Beauxbatons Academy of Magic" are exclusively schools for male and female students, respectively, it explains
the absence of opposite sex in both schools.
